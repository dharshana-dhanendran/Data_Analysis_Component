A data analysis workshop is a structured, hands-on training session where participants learn how to collect, clean, analyze, and interpret data to derive meaningful insights. It typically combines theory, real-world datasets, and practical exercises using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, or Power BI.

Such workshops help participants build practical problem-solving skills in data-driven decision-making.

Core Components of a Data Analysis Workshop
1️⃣ Introduction to Data Analysis

Importance of data in decision-making

Types of data (structured, unstructured, time-series, categorical)

Overview of data analysis lifecycle (from data collection to reporting)

2️⃣ Data Collection & Preparation

Importing datasets (CSV, Excel, SQL databases, APIs)

Data cleaning: handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Data transformation: formatting, normalization, encoding

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, variance, correlation

Data visualization: histograms, scatter plots, boxplots

Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies

4️⃣ Types of Data Analysis

Descriptive Analysis → “What happened?” (summary statistics, dashboards)

Diagnostic Analysis → “Why did it happen?” (correlation, drill-downs)

Predictive Analysis → “What is likely to happen?” (ML models, regression)

Prescriptive Analysis → “What should we do?” (recommendations, optimization)

5️⃣ Hands-On with Tools

Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) – for coding-based analysis

SQL/MySQL – for querying structured data

Power BI / Excel – for dashboards & visualization
